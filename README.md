The Voting Application API enables the creation, management, and participation in voting sessions. It is designed for developers to easily integrate voting functionalities into their applications. Users can create polls, cast votes, and view results in real-time. This API supports basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for managing polls and votes.
